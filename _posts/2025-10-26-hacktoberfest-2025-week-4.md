We are so close to the end of Hacktoberfest I can almost smell it. With one week left to go let's take a look into how last week went.

## GitFichas

After the ‚Äú*big slow down*‚Äù, this week continued the trend of lower amount of pull requests received with only 8 pull requests for last week:

- 8 PRs by the community
    - 7 merged
    - 1 closed

I didn‚Äôt make any pull requests to GitFichas as I was working on a big pull request for work I‚Äôll love to share on next week‚Äôs report.

On other news, this weekend was the first time that GitFichas had no PRs open since the beginning of Hacktoberfest and to be honest this worked out great for me as I was spending most of my Saturday preparing to travel to GitHub Universe.

The gap between closed and open issues is still there, from my side, since my plan is to finish migrating the hand-drawn cards to mermaid before the end of the year, I plan to start tackling some of the open migration issues with the help of Copilot:

- [Migrate all English üá∫üá∏ cards to Mermaid](https://github.com/jtemporal/gitfichas/issues/385): 27 issues to go
- [Migrate all Portuguese üáßüá∑ cards to mermaid](https://github.com/jtemporal/gitfichas/issues/65): 36 issues to go

## Contributor Badges

Hacktoberfest is not over yet! You can still make your contributions and earn at least the 4 of the 6 badge levels:

- level 0 is for registering to Hacktoberfest
- levels 1 through 4 are for making the 4 pull requests while contributing to open source
- level 5 is the supercontributor badge you get while completing 6 pull requests.

I also got the **Plant a tree** and **1 Badge Club**, the first is for the tree planted when you get the shirt for completing 6 PRs, and the second is for anyone that has gotten a Hacktoberfest badge since 2022:
