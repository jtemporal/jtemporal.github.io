This is the second week of Hacktoberfest 2025! For this series of posts we will overview some stats for contributions I received and made over this month. This week I mostly focused on GitFichas due to limited availability, without further ado, let's talk about the contributions.

## GitFichas

This is the first full week of October [GitFichas received 54 pull requests](https://github.com/jtemporal/gitfichas)! Here's the breakdown:

- **53 PRs made by the community**
  - 48 merged
  - 2 closed
  - 3 open

Here's the breakdown of the contributions:

This week I had very little available time to focus on PRs during the week and you can see on the above chart that most contributions were made by the community across the board.

While analyzing the [insights charts](https://github.com/users/jtemporal/projects/1/insights) in the [GitFichas Hacktoberfest 2025 project](https://github.com/users/jtemporal/projects/1), I noticed that my contributions from the first week that focused on making corrections, showed up in the PRs charts but not Issues-related charts since I was making the corrections myself without even opening the issues to track them.

This week unfortunately I had limited time to work on PRs myself due to some changing priorities at work. So instead of making the corrections myself I opened issues for every correction. This would allow me to track changes to make on the weekend and to give a chance to the community to work on them as well. The result from this change in behavior on my end can be seen in the distribution chart below:

If you look at the first chart in the blog post you'll also see that the community made most of the PRs this week.

Speaking of closing issues, here's the burn up for this past week until October 11th:

While issues increased in numbers, we also closed a bunch of them. If the rhythm continues like this, it is likely that we'll have most issues closed at the end of the month. ðŸŽ‰

Monday is a holiday for me so I expect to make a few contributions of my own that I couldn't throughout the week.

That's a wrap for week 2! Stay tuned for next week's update around Hacktoberfest 2025. ðŸŽƒ

See you in the next one.
