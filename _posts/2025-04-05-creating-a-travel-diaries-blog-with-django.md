You started learning Django by creating a blog from the DG tutorial at a Django Girls event near you. This is the first python event you've been to and you fell in love with both the language and the community. Now you have your first application you want to learn how to do more and improve your skills.

![Image of the map in the Django Girls website showing all Django Girls events in a map](/images/travel-diaries-with-django/IMG_0680.jpeg)

This blog post narrates the process of how implement an interactive map and how to embed map into Django website. You'll learn how to create relationships between tables through foreign keys. You’ll also learn how to filter objects in the database using the Django ORM and create specific pages to show the filtered objects.

*Note*: You can also skip ahead to the section *Storing Spacial Data* if you already have the blog from Django Girls tutorial.

## Putting together the Django Girls Tutorial blog

You can go to the [Django Girls Tutorial here](https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/) to learn in more detail how to put together the blog but below you'll see the steps I've taken with some minor edits of my own for simplicity sake.

### Getting started: Set Up

Creating the python environment, installing Django, and creating the blog app:

```
python -m venv .env
source .env/bin/activate# On Windows: .env\Scripts\activate
pip install django
django-admin startproject travel_diaries .
python manage.py startapp blog
```

The first thing to note is that by default Django uses SQLite as the default database, you can check that by looking in `travel_diaries/settings.py` and looking for the `DATABASES` variable and you should see something like this:

```python
DATABASES = {
    "default": {
        "ENGINE": "django.db.backends.sqlite3",
        "NAME": BASE_DIR / "db.sqlite3",
    }
}
```

After creating the blog app you should add it to the `INSTALLED_APPS` list in `travel_diaries/settings.py`:

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    # ...
    'blog',
]
```

I also updated the timezone and the language settings in the same file:

```python
LANGUAGE_CODE = "en-ca"

TIME_ZONE = "America/Toronto"
```

### Creating Superusers

One last thing to do before running the app: creating a user with admin powers.

To do so, you need to run the migrations already created by default when you start your project. This creates the basic structure Django needs to create users for accessing the `/admin`, is through the `/admin` that you can create blog posts.

```
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

Then run the server:

```
python manage.py runserver
```

Now you can also access the admin page and login at [`http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin`](http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin).

### Modeling a Post

The only thing you can do at this point is manage and create users. Let’s change that.

For the purpose of this tutorial you'll only have one user that is you, and you'll be the author of the blog posts, so let's move on to modeling a post. First create the blog app:

```
python manage.py startapp blog
```

Then add the following to `blog/models.py`

```python
from django.db import models
from django.conf import settings
from django.utils import timezone

class Post(models.Model):
    author = models.ForeignKey(settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL, on_delete=models.PROTECT)
    title = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    content = models.TextField()
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(default=timezone.now)
    published_date = models.DateTimeField(blank=True, null=True)

    def publish(self):
        self.published_date = timezone.now()
        self.save()

    def __str__(self):
        return self.title
```

Note that, differently from the Django Girls Tutorial, here we are protecting authors upon deletion of blog posts by using `on_delete=models.Protect`, this avoids the author being deleted when a blog post is deleted.

Then remember to register your new model in the admin so you can see it in `/admin` and be able to create blog posts, to do so open `blog/admin.py` and update the file like so:

```python
from django.contrib import admin
from .models import Post

admin.site.register(Post)
```

If you have the `/admin` page open just refresh it and you should see your `Post` model in there, if not run your server and login to see it.

### Creating Posts

Before you can actually create a post you need to create the corresponding tables on the database, do that by running the two commands below:

```
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

The `makemigrations` command creates scripts to update the database called *migrations*, since this is a new model, the script will create a new table to store the data for each new post. Then the `migrate` command actually run the migrations and creates the tables and other updates.

![Image of the Django Admin with a post being edited](/images/travel-diaries-with-django/IMG_0709.jpeg)

Through the `/admin` interface you should be able to create your blog posts. Take some time to add a couple so you can have some data, this will be used later too.

### Listing Blog Posts in a Page

Time to create HTML and CSS files so we can list our posts and render the posts beautifully.

1. Inside your `blog/` folder, create a `templates/` folder and then a `blog/` folder inside templates;
2. Now create a `base.html` with the following code:
    
    ```html
    {% raw %}{% load static %}
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <head>
      <title>{% block title %}Travel Diaries{% endblock %}</title>
      <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" integrity="sha384-QWTKZyjpPEjISv5WaRU9OFeRpok6YctnYmDr5pNlyT2bRjXh0JMhjY6hW+ALEwIH" crossorigin="anonymous">
      <link rel="stylesheet" href="{% static 'css/blog.css' %}">
    </head>
    <body>
      <header class="page-header">
      <div class="container">
        <h1><a href="/">Travel Diaries</a></h1>
      </div>
      </header><br><br>
      <main class="container">
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col">
          {% block content %}
          {% endblock %}
          </div>
        </div>
      </main>
    </body>
    </html>{% endraw %}
    ```
    
    This base template will hold all the bits of HTML you can reuse across all other pages that extend it.
    
3. Create also a `post_list.html` like so:
    
    ```html
    {% raw %}{% extends 'blog/base.html' %}
    
    {% block content %}
      {% for post in posts %}
        <article>
          <h2><a href="{% url 'post_detail' pk=post.pk %}">{{ post.title }}</a> <small> • <time>published: {{ post.published_date }}</time></small></h2>
        </article>
      {% endfor %}
    {% endblock %}{% endraw %}
    ```
    
    *Note: This post list is a bit different from that on the Django Girls tutorial as it only displays the Post title and publishing date.*
    
4. And finally `post_detail.html`:
    
    ```html
    {% raw %}
    {% extends 'blog/base.html' %}
    
    {% block content %}
      <article>
        <h2>{{ post.title }}</h2>
        <small><time>published: {{ post.published_date }}</time></small>
        <br><br>
      <p>{{ post.content | safe | linebreaks }}</p>
      </article>
    {% endblock %}
    {% endraw %}
    ```
    
    *Note: This post detail is also a bit different from that on the Django Girls tutorial as it not only displays the Post content but also allow for rendering HTMLs that might be part of the post like the embedded code for a YouTube video for example.*
    
5. Now you may have noticed the usage of a CSS file in the `base.html`, but you currently don't have that file, so let's us create it, create a `static/` folder inside your blog app folder and in it a `css/` folder containing a `blog.css` file with the following content:
    
    ```css
    h1 a, h2 a {
        color: #c175ff;
    }
    ```
    
    Make sure to change the color you see there as a hex code to one of your liking.
    
6. Now you need a view or better views to use these amazing templates. So update `blog/views.py` to this:
    
    ```python
    from django.shortcuts import render, get_object_or_404
    from django.utils import timezone
    from .models import Post
    
    def post_list(request):
        posts = Post.objects.filter(published_date__lte=timezone.now()).order_by('-published_date')
        return render(request, 'blog/post_list.html', {"posts": posts})
    
    def post_detail(request, pk):
        post = get_object_or_404(Post, pk=pk)
        return render(request, 'blog/post_detail.html', {"post": post})
    ```
    
    The `post_list` function will grab all posts you have order them by the publish date putting the most recent blog post first in the `posts`. This filter returns a `QuerySet` that gets injected into the page when the `render()` is called. You can think of this `QuerySet` as a list resulting of filtering the posts in the database.
    
    The `post_detail` function on the other hand, is responsible for rendering a given post in its own page, it finds the post if it exists using its primary key and injects that through the render function.
    
7. To make use of the HTMLs and Views you need to update the URLs so your application know how to render the blog pages, so create the `urls.py` file within your blog app and update the `blog/urls.py` like this:
    
    ```python
    from django.urls import path
    from . import views
    
    urlpatterns = [
        path('', views.post_list, name='post_list'),
        path('post/<int:pk>', views.post_detail, name='post_detail'),
    ]
    ```
    
    The first pattern uses the `post_list.html` and corresponding homonyms view to render the list of posts while the second is responsible for generating a page for each individual post. Note that the post URL for an individual post follows a pattern like `post/1` where the `1` is the primary key of a post in the database.
    
    An improvement for a later date is to use the post slug for generating the URL as opposed to the primary key.
    

Now you can see a post like this:

![Image showing one post](/images/travel-diaries-with-django/IMG_0710.jpeg)

## Storing Spacial Data

Up until now it you had a recap of the Django Girls Tutorial with some tiny differences. If you want more details you can find it in the [Django Girls Tutorial](https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en).

But let's move to the fun parts! First things first, we need to make a decision: *should you store the location as part of the post model itself or should you create a separate object to store the information? And if you separate things in different models, should you keep things in the same app or put things in a separate app entirely?*

To facilitate re-usability, since you can have more than one blog post for a given location, maybe a place you visit quite often, is better to separate the location as its own model.

With the same mindset, we should be able to keep each module as specific to the part of the application it contains, it is a good practice to separate responsibilities into different apps, having a separate app also allows you to re-use this code in other projects, so that's what we'll do in this blog post.

### Creating Map App

The app to hold the locations will be named Map and will host all logic for locations and the map generation. Splitting this allow you for example to reutilize the code at other applications with little refactor, and also for the map to exist almost independently from your blog. Let's create a new app:

```
python manage.py startapp map
```

Then add that to your application by updating the `travel_diaries/settings.py`:

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
# ... previous installed apps
    "django.contrib.staticfiles",
    "blog",
    "map",
]
```

### Modeling a Location

In order to show locations both on the blog and on the map you need to be able store them so we need a model, update `map/models.py` like so:

```python
from django.db import models

class Location(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    latitude = models.DecimalField(max_digits=12, decimal_places=8, blank=True, null=True)
    longitude = models.DecimalField(max_digits=12, decimal_places=8, blank=True, null=True)

    def __str__(self):
        return self.name
```

Put simply a Location has a name and the coordinates to find it in a map (latitude and longitude). 

Since you now have a model is a good time to create the corresponding table on your database, run:

```
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

### Creating a Map

Now that you have a model you need to both add a view for it, and add it to the admin so you can create new locations. Let's start with the basics: creating the view. Go to the `map/views.py` and add the following code:

```python
import folium
from django.http import HttpResponse
from .models import Location

def map_page(request):
    center = (13.133932434766733, 16.103938729508073)
    folium_map = folium.Map(location=center, zoom_start=2)
    return HttpResponse(folium_map.get_root().render())
```

Let's breakdown what is happening:

1. `folium`: is a library to that allows you to create maps in Python with Leafleet.js, you can check out the [Folium documentation here](https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/latest/) or this other [blog post I wrote to learn the Folium basics (translated with the help of Google from Portuguese - for now](https://jtemporal-com.translate.goog/folium/?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en-US&_x_tr_pto=wapp)[)](https://jtemporal.com/folium/);
2. `folium.Map`: creates a map of the world far enough to see most of the world map;
3. `folium_map.get_root().render()`: exports the created map into an HTML as a string that can be passed to the view.

After updating the `map/views.py` install Folium like this:

```
pip install folium
```

Define the URL patterns for map app in the `map/urls.py` like this:

```python
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('', views.map_page, name='map'),
]
```

And add the map app to the application URLs in the `travel_diaries/urls.py` like this:

```python
# ... pre-existing imports

urlpatterns = [
    path("admin/", admin.site.urls),
    path("", include("blog.urls")),
    path("map/", include("map.urls")),  # 👈 added code
]
```

With these alterations every time someone access `/map` endpoint on your site they will see the map created.

Double check your work: access [`http://127.0.0.1:8000/map`](https://127.0.0.1:8000/map) to see the blank map.

![Image showing showing the plain map](/images/travel-diaries-with-django/IMG_0694.jpeg)

That's cool but too "basic" so let's add some locations and pins to our map.

### Creating Locations

Now that you have a view and a model make sure to register the model on the `map/admin.py` file in order to see locations in the admin UI:

```python
from django.contrib import admin
from .models import Location

admin.site.register(Location)
```

If your server is running, refresh your page to see the update, if not, run your server and login to the admin panel in order to create locations.

![Image of the Django admin now showing also Locations](/images/travel-diaries-with-django/IMG_0696.jpeg)

Make sure to add a few that would correspond to each of your blog posts.

### Adding Locations to Blog Posts

Now since you want to associate each blog post to a given location we need to adjust the blog post model and make some improvements to the HTML templates.

Let's begin by updating the Post model in the `blog/models.py` you'll add a new field called `location` and it will be a `ForeignKey`. This will create a link between your post in the Post table and location that exists in the Location table.

Since you want to be able to create blog posts that aren't tied to a location, you'll also want to make this field optional by using the parameters `blank` and `null`. This will also help since you want to put a default location or have to implement your own migration in order to fill the field in the database.

```python
# other imports omitted
from map.models import Location  # 👈 new import

class Post(models.Model):
    # other fields omitted
    published_date = models.DateTimeField(blank=True, null=True)
    # 👇 new code
    location = models.ForeignKey(
        Location, related_name='place',
        blank=True, null=True,  # allow for blog posts without location
        on_delete=models.PROTECT  # keep location if a blog post gets deleted
    )
    # 👆 new code
    # omitted pre-existing code
```

Okay now let's update the templates, start with the `post_detail.html`. Add the following after the closing `</time>` tag in the HTML:

```html
{% raw %}{% if post.location %} • {{ post.location }}{% endif %}{% endraw %}
```

This will render the location of a post in the post page if that blog post has a location filled in. Since the location is part of the post object as foreign key, you can still access it through the post object we pass in the `render` function of the post detail view.

![Image of a post now with the Location](/images/travel-diaries-with-django/IMG_0688.jpeg)

Make sure to add some locations through the admin page *and* update the blog posts to have locations

## Linking The Map in the Main Page

While you are editing templates might be a good time to link the Map in the footer of the base template. Open the `base.html` and add the code below after the closing of the `</main>` tag:

```html
    {% raw %}<footer class="page-footer">
        <div class="container">
            <br>
            <p><a href="/map"> Map </a></p>
        </div>
    {% endraw %}</footer>
```

Finally, you may have noticed that this hyperlink is rendering in that awful blue color so update the CSS file so that this hyper link also renders in your chosen color, replace the content of `blog/static/css/blog.css` with this:

```css
h1 a, h2 a, p a {
    color: #c175ff;
}
```

This way you can see your map with the same color setting for all other links in your page like this:

![Image of the post list from the user perspective with the map link in the footer circled](/images/travel-diaries-with-django/IMG_0683.jpeg)

## Showing Locations on a Map

Okay now that you have locations you should be able to see them in the map, right? Wrong! Our map has no information to display yet, to change that you need to update the map view. Add this code to it:

```python
# other imports omitted
from django.http import HttpResponse
from .models import Location

def map_page(request):
    center = (13.133932434766733, 16.103938729508073)
    folium_map = folium.Map(location=center, zoom_start=2)
    # 👇 new code
    locations = Location.objects.all()
    for location in locations:
        popup = f"{location.name}"
        folium.Marker(
            location=[location.latitude, location.longitude],
            popup=popup
        ).add_to(folium_map)
    # 👆 new code
    return HttpResponse(folium_map.get_root().render())
```

This extra code does the following:

1. Queries all the locations in the database with `Location.objects.all()`;
2. Then iterates over the QuerySet of locations to add a `folium.Marker` using the name and coordinates for each location.

After adding some locations you should be able to access [`http://127.0.0.1:8000/map`](https://127.0.0.1:8000/map) and see a map with the locations you created with their corresponding pins.

![Image showing the map now with pins for each location](/images/travel-diaries-with-django/IMG_0697.png)

## Creating Location Pages

Now this is all fun, let's make it more *complete*. One fun thing to do using views is to generate pages based on the data you have stored in the database. So let's create a new view to get a list of posts for a given location, add the code below on `map/views.py`:

```python
# other imports omitted
from django.utils import timezone
from blog.models import Post

# other views omitted

def post_list_by_location(request, name):
    location = Location.objects.get(name__iexact=name)

    posts = Post.objects.filter(
        location=location, published_date__lte=timezone.now()
    ).order_by('-published_date')

    return render(
        request, 'map/post_list_by_location.html',
        {"posts": posts, "location": location}
    )
```

Lets breakdown the code:

1. `Location.objects.get(name__iexact=name)`: filters location based on the name without caring for capitalization;
2. Then we get all the posts using `Post.objects.filter` passing the location from the previous step;
3. Finally we pass the posts and the location to the page rendered by the template `map/post_list_by_location.html`.

Speaking of template, now that we have a new view that actually uses templates create the templates folder to host the HTML that will be used by this view like this:

```bash
mkdir -p map/templates/map/
```

Then create a new template in the `map/templates/map/` folder named `post_list_by_location.html`:

```html
{% raw %}{% extends 'blog/base.html' %}

{% block content %}
    <h2>Posts in {{ location }}</h2><br>

    {% for post in posts %}
      <article>
        <h2><a href="{% url 'post_detail' pk=post.pk %}">{{ post.title }}</a> <small> • <time>published: {{ post.published_date }}</time></small></h2>
      </article>
    {% endfor %}
{% endblock %}{% endraw %}
```

And to you can see the pages add the new URL patterns in `map/urls.py`:

```python
# imports omitted

urlpatterns = [
    path('', views.map_page, name='map'),
    path('<name>', views.post_list_by_location),  # 👈 new code
]
```

The `<name>` ensures the part of the URL path that will contain the name of the location will be passed along to the view: for example accessing [`http://127.0.0.1:8000/map/london`](https://127.0.0.1:8000/map/london) will render the corresponding London page with the collection of posts related to London.

![Image showing the page for a given location with a list of corresponding blog posts](/images/travel-diaries-with-django/IMG_0714.jpeg)

## Linking Location Pages in the Map

One final thing: might be fun to add a tiny preview map of the location on the page so lets update the view:

```python
# pre-existing code
def post_list_by_location(request, name):
    location = Location.objects.get(name__iexact=name)

    # 👇 new code
    folium_map = folium.Map(
        location=[location.latitude, location.longitude],
        zoom_start=4, width=400, height=300
    )
    folium.Marker(
            location=[location.latitude, location.longitude],
            popup=location.name
        ).add_to(folium_map)

    location_map = folium_map._repr_html_()
    # 👆 new code

    posts = Post.objects.filter(
        location=location, published_date__lte=timezone.now()
    ).order_by('-published_date')

    return render(
        request, 'map/post_list_by_location.html',
        # 👇 updated code
        {"posts": posts, "location": location, "location_map": location_map}
        # 👆 updated code
    )
```

1. `folium.Map`: creates a map;
2. `folium.Marker`: adds the pin to map;
3. `folium_map._repr_html_()`: generates the HTML for the map;
4. then finally, `"location_map": location_map` we pass the HTML map to be injected into the page.

And now update the template HTML file `map/templates/map/post_list_by_location.html` like so:

```html
{% raw %}{% extends 'blog/base.html' %}

{% block content %}
    <h2>Posts in {{ location }}</h2><br>
    <!-- 👇 new code -->
    <div class="row" style="width:50%">
        <center>
            {{ location_map | safe }}
        </center>
    </div><br>
    <!-- 👆 new code -->
    {% for post in posts %}
        <article>
            <h2><a href="{% url 'post_detail' pk=post.pk %}">{{ post.title }}</a> <small> • <time>published: {{ post.published_date }}</time></small></h2>
        </article>
    {% endfor %}
{% endblock %}{% endraw %}
```

This update then render the map as a part of the page:

Now we need to add a link to this pages somewhere right? So let's use our Map. Update the view that generate the markers on the map `map/views.py` like so:

```python
def map_page(request):
    center = (13.133932434766733, 16.103938729508073)
    folium_map = folium.Map(location=center, zoom_start=2)
    locations = Location.objects.all()
    for location in locations:
        # 👇 updated code
        popup = f"""
        <a href="/map/{location.name}">{location.name}</a>
        """
        # 👆 updated code
        folium.Marker(
            location=[location.latitude, location.longitude],
            popup=popup
        ).add_to(folium_map)
    folium_map.save("map/templates/map/map.html")
    return render(request, "map/map.html")
```

And that is it, you are good to go! Go checkout the `/map` page and try clicking on the name of one of your locations:

## Recap

Wow, that was a lot! You learned or remembered how to create a blog in the style of the Django Girls tutorial with some tiny differences to make the experience more personalized. Then you got to have fun and learn how to use Folium to generate maps and embed those maps in pages on your page.

On the Django side you saw how to use foreign keys to link your posts to locations and how filter posts based on the relationship they had with that location. And then you saw how to create specific pages with the filtered list of posts.

I hope you had as much fun reading as I had writing this, if you read until here I'd love to hear/read your questions so [send me a message on Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/jesstemporal.com).

Before you go if you want to think of next steps for you to stretch your skills I recommend you trying both saving the map once a new location is added this way you can just render the map as opposed to querying the the database every time `/map` is accessed and creating a 404 page in case some tries to access locations that don't exist.

See ya on the next one.
