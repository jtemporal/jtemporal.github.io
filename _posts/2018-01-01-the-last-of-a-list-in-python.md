[Python](https://www.python.org/) is known for making it easy to write beautiful, small code. Today's pro tip is about how to get the last element of a list using this language \o/

You can watch below or continue reading:

Coming from other languages like Java or C to Python, it's normal to bring a bit of an accent to your codes and want to do something more or less like this to get the last element of a list:

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
item_index = len(my_list) - 1
print(item_index)
# 4
last_one = my_list[item_index]
print(last_one)
# 5
```

Use the `len()` size function to get the length of the list and subtract `1` to get the index of the last element in that list. And that's ok! It works. However, Python presents a more elegant way of doing this, see:

```python
last_one = my_list[-1]
print(last_one)
# 5
```

Even though it may seem like this, it's not magic! From the [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#common-sequence-operations):

> If i or j is negative, the index is relative to the end of sequence _s_: `len(s) + i` or `len(s) + j` is substituted. But note that `-0` is still `0`.

In a simpler way, [Raymond Hettinger](https://twitter.com/raymondh) explains in this tweet with code:

The implementation is actually more complex than this, but what happens in general terms: the `__getitem__` method is invoked when we call `my_list[-1]` receiving the list itself (`self`) and the negative index (`i`) then adds this index with the size of the list and returns the updated index value. Interestingly, this was the same thing I did on the first example but it is already implemented by default.

And a little detail, the same can be done for strings!

```python
word = 'yes'
print(word[-1])
# s
```

Dope, right? Now just use negative index in your codes too ðŸ˜‰
