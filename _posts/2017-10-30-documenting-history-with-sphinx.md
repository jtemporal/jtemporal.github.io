Have you seen those beautiful library documentations around? For example, [Bottery](https://docs.bottery.io/en/latest/) or [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/)? They are all built with a Python library called [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/#).

Sphinx was created to generate Python's own documentation and is now widely used because it facilitates automated library documentation building. One cool thing you can do is use Sphinx to build a history of events as done in the [Python Brasil's Big Kahuna Manual](http://manual-do-big-kahuna.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

With the goal of creating the same type of historical record for regional events, I started a [repository for PythonSudeste](https://github.com/pythonsudeste/pythonsudeste_documentacao) and now also one for PyConAmazÃ´nia which, thanks to Nilo Menezes, has a complete [post mortem](https://www.dropbox.com/s/tr83g5j5amdkyxt/Pycon%20Amaz%C3%B4nia%202017%20-%20Memorial%20da%20Organiza%C3%A7%C3%A3o%20do%20Evento.pdf?dl=0) of the organization made available to the community.

I'll narrate here the steps I took hoping that more regional event organizers can make the same type of historical record of their events available.

# Everything starts with a git repository

I started by adding two files:

- `requirements.txt`: this contains the libraries we'll use to generate the documentation
- `README.md`: this contains information on how to run the project

<script src="https://gist.github.com/jtemporal/7e6a99f4245407367dc07740b04f925e.js"></script>

The Sphinx project we'll use here runs in a virtual environment with Python 3. I particularly like using [`virtualenv`](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/) to create my environment:

```bash
virtualenv .env
source .env/bin/activate # may vary depending on your system
```

And to install the dependencies:

```console
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

After installation, we start by running Sphinx's quickstart:

```
sphinx-quickstart
```

This quickstart will ask you numerous questions about how to build your documentation. Some important points about these questions:

- Running `sphinx-quickstart` you'll need to answer things like "What's the project name?", "What's the author's name?" and "What's the content language?", so it's important to answer each question carefully ;)
- At some point in this questionnaire, the decision is made about separating build and source, and here's the tip: If you're going to put it on [ReadTheDocs](https://readthedocs.org/) you do **not** need to commit the build \o/

At the end of this long questionnaire we just answered, you'll find a ready-to-use structure:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/jtemporal/e4ef18051ec0d627678ad658826dc362.js"></script>

# build/

Initially empty, but when we run the build command it will get filled up ;P

# source/

That's where we'll put all our files that will become pages of our project.

# conf.py

The answers we gave during quickstart are stored inside this configuration file and it's what sphinx uses to generate the `.html` files from the text files. Note here that Sphinx's preferred extension is `.rst` for reStructuredText and I suspect they chose `.rst` because it's an indentation-based writing form. ðŸ‘€

# index.rst

It's from `index.rst` that Sphinx will build your documentation's `index.html`. If you open the index.rst on GitHub you'll see that it's relatively simple:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/jtemporal/39028b49f8c0b851b4bfccf2b4a149fc.js"></script>

This is the "factory version" of `index.rst` that is created when running quickstart. With it, you can already run an initial build of the site. To build the site we use `make`, which is responsible for finding the `.rst` files in the project directory and "translating" them to `.html`. Let's see:

```
make html
```

After running the build without errors, the result on screen should look like this:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/jtemporal/123389890312d764ec16bcea64e06178.js"></script>

*But Jessica, why build if you said above that ReadTheDocs doesn't need it?* It's true, but the easiest way to check the result of your work is locally and for that you need the `.html` pages.

Another thing you'll need is a way to view these pages. Of course you can just open the `.html` files in your favorite browser, but another option is to use a server. Servers were added as part of Python 3's [built-in `http` module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.server.html#module-http.server) and are very useful in cases like this. To start a server process just run:

```
python -m "http.server"
```

And using the browser access the path `localhost:8000`. While running the process from the project root as we did, you should see a listing of all files and directories in your browser:

<center>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/cLzKN77.png" style="max-width: 60%;">
</center>

Then just follow the path to the folder where the `.html` files are:

<center>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/1XNPT8Q.png" style="max-width: 60%;">
</center>

When clicking on `html/`, since it contains an `index.html` file, your browser will show the result of the build which looks something like this using the factory-generated `index.rst`:

# Content Introduction \o/

All these steps so far were to prepare our project to get to the part we really want. Let's start by creating a content page called `pyconamazonia2017.rst` with just a title and create the connection between it and our `index.rst`.

<center>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/jtemporal/8d6a0aea5efe3dd251e4787b876863df.js"></script>
</center>

<center>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/jtemporal/b604f5ea85b0240cf2466a91b3726e23.js"></script>
</center>

When running the build we'll get the following result:

<center>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/nA3IG1u.png">
<small>
<i>build result for pyconamazonia.rst</i>
</small>
</center>

<center>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/7ReRbwJ.png">
<small>
<i>build result for index.rst</i>
</small>
</center>

Changing the content of this `index.rst` a bit to add a cover for example we have:

<center>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/jtemporal/5d026f71e9bad58e1ce064551cf49615.js"></script>
</center>

Note: the image didn't render here because the link only works within the project since it has a folder containing the image. After building, the page looks like this:

![rendering the project with cover](https://i.imgur.com/skq9ygN.png)

From there, just continue filling and connecting new pages in whatever way you find most interesting ;)

---

After all this you might think the default theme for the pages isn't great and want to change it. Sphinx has several built-in themes but here we'll use the ReadTheDocs theme. First, we start by adding it to `requirements.txt`:

<center>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/jtemporal/32648f3777c33ff2feb8961c49be9173.js"></script>
<small>
<i>requirements.txt with the ReadTheDocs theme</i>
</small>
</center>

And then installing it like this:

```console
(.env) $ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now we just need to change the theme variable value in the configuration file (`conf.py`) to use the ReadTheDocs theme:

```console
html_theme = 'sphinx_rtd_theme'
```

And when building again, your home page will look like this:

# Considerations

The PyConAmazÃ´nia memorial project was structured to receive **the highest number of possible contributions**. If you want to [check out how this is going on GitHub](https://github.com/pythonbrasil/pycon-amazonia-memorial) ðŸŽ‰

And a tip about `.rst` is to [use this cheatsheet](https://github.com/ralsina/rst-cheatsheet/blob/master/rst-cheatsheet.rst) when you don't know how to do something in restructured text ðŸ™ƒ

Now, the part about putting all this online is for the next post, that's all folks ;)
