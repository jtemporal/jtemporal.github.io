We made it! After four weeks of preptember, Hacktoberfest is finally here and I couldn't be more excited! My most used emoji this week was ðŸŽ‰ for sure and I can foresee that this one will take the trophy for the month!

For this series of posts we will overview some stats for contributions I received and made over this month so let's talk about the contributions.

## GitFichas

In this first half week of October [GitFichas received 42 pull requests](https://github.com/jtemporal/gitfichas)! Here's the breakdown:

- **26 PRs made by the community**
  - 18 merged
  - 6 closed
  - 2 unmerged

Here's the breakdown of the contributions:

My contributions (16 PRs) focused on either improving documentation or make corrections based on the PRs received. I noticed some sort of OS difference is going on and for some contributors the SVG generation has been truncating the text no matter where the break lines are.

GitFichas also has a project you can follow along if you are curious [you can check it here](https://github.com/users/jtemporal/projects/1). The interesting part about it is the [insights page](https://github.com/users/jtemporal/projects/1/insights) where you can see some charts like the one below.

## Other projects

Between reviewing the PRs and making other ones to keep the health of GitFichas I ended up not spending as much time as I would like on other projects.

I still added 2 new projects on the brazilian projects list: [uvicorn](https://github.com/jtemporal/jtemporal.github.io/pull/325) and [starlette](https://github.com/jtemporal/jtemporal.github.io/pull/324) both maintained by [Marcelo Trylesinski](https://github.com/Kludex).

And finally implemented the [series widget here on the blog](https://github.com/jtemporal/jtemporal.github.io/pull/327) so you can see related posts that are part of a series like the one from Preptember and this one.

That's a wrap for week 1! Stay tuned for more updates as Hacktoberfest 2025 continues. ðŸŽƒ
