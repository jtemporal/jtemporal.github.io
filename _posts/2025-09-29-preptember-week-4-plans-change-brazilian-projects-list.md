The last weekend of preptember is here! I thought the previous weekend was different from the first two, but this one was different in a whole new way. I definitely overestimated my energy levels coming back from [Oktane](https://www.okta.com/oktane/) and underestimated the jet-lag effects.

**TLDR:** New issues open in GitFichas and two "easy" PRs preparing the curated list of Brazilian open source projects for Hacktoberfest 2025. One broke production, the other fixed the problem.

## Recap

Last weekend I implemented 6 color schemes for GitFichas, bringing back the visual variety that made the original hand-drawn cards special. I also improved the GitHub Copilot instructions to help contributors have better AI-assisted experiences during Hacktoberfest. Despite a busier schedule due to Oktane preparation, I managed to close multiple issues while migrating Portuguese and English cards to the new Mermaid format.

## Past week's work

Between staffing the Auth0 for AI Agents booth and presenting an awesome workshop called "Auth-ing your GenAI" at Oktane, traveling took its toll on me. And don't even get me started on the jet lag.

I travel to the west coast enough to know I'll always wake up way too early and go to bed too late because it's a conference and there's always another conversation I don't want to miss. Long story short: I ended up sleeping less than I should have this week.

With that said, it only made sense that the plans for this weekend needed some changing, mainly because I needed to recover from the trip before I could make something useful. The only issue is that looking back, I noticed that I probably didn't rest as much as I should have before touching any repo. ðŸ˜…

For GitFichas, I only focused on creating new issues. During the week, before breakfast one day, I opened over 50 issues for translations into Spanish since we can now support the language. All [translation issues have the translation tag](https://github.com/jtemporal/gitfichas/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3Atranslation).

With these issues open, I consider GitFichas ready for Hacktoberfest. ðŸŽ‰

Speaking of being ready for Hacktoberfest, all PRs I made were on [this blog's repository](https://github.com/jtemporal/jtemporal.github.io):

- **[PR #309](https://github.com/jtemporal/jtemporal.github.io/pull/309):** Moved the projects from last year into its own folder and created the 2025 folder;
- **[PR #310](https://github.com/jtemporal/jtemporal.github.io/pull/310):** Holds the draft list since the repositories, at the time of writing this, still require review so the list can be published. I will get to it right after publishing this one;
- **[PR #311](https://github.com/jtemporal/jtemporal.github.io/pull/311):** Re-adds the past versions of the list as their own collections, which by the way I called "groupings" in all commits I made because I couldn't remember the word "collections"... _I told you I should've rested more._ ðŸ‘€

### How the list started

A little context if you are new here: since 2017 with the help of the Brazilian dev community I curate a list of Brazilian open source projects.

The list started on Medium and stayed there for the first two editions [in 2017](https://medium.com/nossa-coletividad/projetos-brasileiros-para-fazer-pull-requests-nesse-hacktoberfest-4dc9b9b576c0) and [in 2018](https://medium.com/@jessicatemporal/projetos-brasileiros-para-contribuir-nesse-hacktoberfest-vers%C3%A3o-2018-4925959b9411).

I ultimately wanted the community to be able to contribute to it, so I moved the list into GitHub [in 2019](https://jtemporal.com/projetos-brasileiros-para-fazer-pull-requests-nesse-hacktoberfest-o-retorno/) under my own blog to make it easy for folks to contribute to it.

### Keeping the history

One thing that made me unhappy with the way I was structuring the data for the Hacktoberfest list between 2019 and 2024 was that every year I would overwrite the list.

Not too big of a deal if you ask me, the blog post mostly gets views in the corresponding year anyway, but it still bothered me, though not enough to fix it until this year.

For some reason, I felt 2025 deserved a proper historical representation of the list, and now if you navigate to the previous years' lists, you'll get to see how the list changed.

These are all the past lists:

- [2017](https://medium.com/nossa-coletividad/projetos-brasileiros-para-fazer-pull-requests-nesse-hacktoberfest-4dc9b9b576c0)
- [2018](https://medium.com/@jessicatemporal/projetos-brasileiros-para-contribuir-nesse-hacktoberfest-vers%C3%A3o-2018-4925959b9411)
- [2019](https://jtemporal.com/projetos-brasileiros-para-fazer-pull-requests-nesse-hacktoberfest-o-retorno)
- [2020](http://jtemporal.com/projetos-brasileiros-para-fazer-pull-requests-nesse-hacktoberfest-2020)
- [2021](https://jtemporal.com/projetos-brasileiros-para-fazer-pull-requests-nesse-hacktoberfest-2021)
- [2022](https://jtemporal.com/projetos-brasileiros-para-contribuir-hacktoberfest-2022)
- [2023](https://jtemporal.com/projetos-br-hacktoberfest-2023)
- [2024](https://jtemporal.com/projetos-br-hacktoberfest-2024)

### Breaking prod just a little bit

In my tiredness I made a tiny mistake.

You see, the list worked based on a single collection: `_hacktoberfest_projects`. This collection would then render list on the post with a liquid code that started like this:

{% raw %}
```html
{% assign grouped = site.hacktoberfest_projects | group_by: "principal_language" %}
```
{% endraw %}

Then I copied the original list into a `_hacktoberfest_projects_2025` folder and to avoid confusion moved the previous folder into `_hacktoberfest_projects_2024`.

The issue being: when the original projects folder no longer existed, Jekyll gave out zero errors and then previous versions of the list started to show empty content. There should be a list of projects before the signature on the image below.

</center>

So **[PR #309](https://github.com/jtemporal/jtemporal.github.io/pull/309)** silently broke production since I, of course, merged the PR forgetting about the past years.

I then started working on this blog post you are reading right now and wanted to give the context for past lists, so I noticed the broken pages and that is how **[PR #311](https://github.com/jtemporal/jtemporal.github.io/pull/311)** came about.

### Fixing prod with some work

Now I had to pick a path and fix the problem of my own tired mind creation:

1. Pick the content from `_hacktoberfest_projects` from before PR #309, and apply that so all lists before 2024 would look the same; or
2. Pick the content from each past year and apply that in a new PR so all lists will have accurate data to show.

If you read until now, you can probably guess what I did. ðŸ‘€

Yep, I picked solution number 2.

In my brain, the easy way to do this was to:

1. Pick a commit after each Hacktoberfest to grab the projects folder
2. Copy the folder and add that to my working branch

Easy enough... The challenge became finding a commit in that period of time I could "jump into" to copy the folder from. So I got into the [commits list](https://github.com/jtemporal/jtemporal.github.io/commits/main) in GitHub and then used the date button to filter out the dates like this:

<center>
<img alt="GitHub commits page showing date-based filtering interface to search for commits within specific time periods" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/jesstemporal/image/upload/v1759181171/commits-search-based-on-date-on-github.png" style="max-width: 80%;" />
</center>

From there I picked a commit and jumped into it:

```sh
git switch 73fb9b686218251be6f5b1770f0151150a664862 --detach
```

Then copied the folder and created a stash with it:

```sh
cp -r _hacktoberfest_projects _hacktoberfest_projects_2019
git add _hacktoberfest_projects_2019
git stash
```

Then went back to the working branch and applied the changes from the stash:

```sh
git switch hacktoberfest-projects-history
git stash pop
```

After that I made the other changes like updating the config files and previous posts and then finally made the necessary commits. Because I couldn't think of a better way to do this, I repeated that same process four more times.

In case you are curious these are the other commits I switched into:

```sh
git switch d4550d0c7f7ee492c334706749475d2235caec16 --detach
git switch ad60ba9a1b950d521419e86cf5c7547b9b922827 --detach
git switch 874b8f53cbe52e5c1d3f3832921c5d38b542dda1 --detach
git switch d2fc775c9e02569b78a43391ab49330384ed26ab --detach
```

There's probably an easier or even a smarter way to do this but this worked well for yesterday's tired me and if it works you don't mess with it. You can see all the changes and commits in **[PR #311](https://github.com/jtemporal/jtemporal.github.io/pull/311)**.

## What's next

October starts this week, so next weekend I'll be focusing on my first PRs for Hacktoberfest, these are the ones I plan on working on myself to start:

- [Issue #173 in GitFichas](https://github.com/jtemporal/gitfichas/issues/173): Generating a preview image for each of the cards to make them easy to share;
- [PR #166 in the PyLadiesCon repository](https://github.com/pyladies/pyladiescon-portal/pull/166);

And I know the PR #166 doesn't count for this Hacktoberfest but it will unblock others from contributing hence why I want to spend some time with it.

## Join me

I hope this post also inspires you to learn when you need to rest and adjust your plans accordingly, even though I don't think I did that particularly well this time around.

Sometimes taking a pause is just as important as pushing forward.

If you are looking for a low-code project to contribute to, [GitFichas](https://github.com/jtemporal/gitfichas) has over 130 issues open right now. And if you need help with your contributions, [drop me a note somewhere](http://jtemporal.com/socials/).
