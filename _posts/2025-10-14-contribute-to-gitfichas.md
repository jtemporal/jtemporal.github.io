Looking for an open source project to contribute to? Let me tell you about [GitFichas](https://github.com/jtemporal/gitfichas), a visual study cards project about Git in multiple languages.

## What is GitFichas?

GitFichas creates visual study cards (fichas in Portuguese) that help developers understand Git concepts through diagrams and flowcharts. Think of it as flashcards for Git, but built with modern web technologies and designed to be accessible to developers worldwide.

The project supports multiple languages: Portuguese, English, Spanish, and more coming! It uses Mermaid diagrams to create beautiful and friendly study materials.

## Real Impact

During the first 10 days of Hacktoberfest 2025, GitFichas saw incredible community engagement with [**over 80 total pull requests merged**](https://github.com/users/jtemporal/projects/1/views/10).

This isn't just about numbers - this proves the community wants to make Git education better for everyone.

## Why Your Contribution Matters

When you contribute to GitFichas, you're not just adding code or content, you're also helping other developers understand Git better. Every translation makes the project accessible to new communities. Every bug fix improves the learning experience. Every new study card helps someone grasp a complex concept.

### Ready to Contribute?

1. **Explore the project on GitHub**: [github.com/jtemporal/gitfichas](https://github.com/jtemporal/gitfichas)
2. **Check out the issues**: Look for [issues with labels](https://github.com/jtemporal/gitfichas/issues) that match your interests like `bug` or `enhancement`
3. **Join the conversation**: Comment on issues to ask questions or show interest in working on them

Then make your PR.

#### Set Up Your Environment

I suggest you use GitHub Codespaces but you can also run things locally if you prefer:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jtemporal/gitfichas.git
cd gitfichas
./setup.sh  # One command sets up everything!
```

#### You Can Use AI to Help You

GitFichas embraces AI and there are GitHub Copilot instructions to help you:

- Understand the codebase structure
- Follow project conventions
- Migrate cards from hand-drawn initial format to the current Mermaid format

#### Make Your Contribution

Whether it's translating a study card, fixing a typo, or migrating a card, every contribution makes Git learning better for developers worldwide. Don't [forget to link the issue in your PR description](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/using-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) and wait for me to review.

## Types of Contributions We Love

These are some of the contributions we have issues for at the moment:

**1. Translations**
