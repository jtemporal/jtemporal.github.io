After GitHub Universe, recovering from a nasty cold, and a lot of work, I know I'm a bit late but here it goes: Final week of Hacktoberfest 2025 report!

## GitFichas

After the “*big slow down*”, we actually saw some more engagement by the community with 5 pull requests in Hacktoberfest's last week:

- 5 PRs by the community
    - 3 merged
    - 2 open

I, on the other hand, got Copilot to work on a few issues 👀: 35 pull requests by AI, all merged. This meant great progress was made and that huge bump in the last days of October in the burn up chart below.

The gap between closed and open issues is still there. I still plan to finish migrating the hand-drawn cards to mermaid before the end of the year but I also want to reach the 100 cards published number, let's see how it goes.

Here's the distribution of pull requests worked on in the last week of Hacktoberfest:

Looking at the pull requests for the whole month of October, you can see that shift between a lot of translation pull requests in the beginning of the month to more migrations at the end of October in the chart below:

As far as issues go, the distribution is similar. Some PRs closed more than one issue and some PRs had no issues attached to them, so the numbers vary a bit between merged PRs and closed issues, but the distribution is similar on both:

## Other projects

I went back to those PRs I left hanging and worked on them. And now I'm off to work on other stuff, especially some content I want to work on through the end of this year beginning of next one.

With this report we close a successful Hacktoberfest 2025. I was not expecting so many people interested in contributing to GitFichas, and I was very happy to review every pull request that came through.

I hope the folks contributing also had an amazing time as I did.

Happy hacking and see you next year 🎃
